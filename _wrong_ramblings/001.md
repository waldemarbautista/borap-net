If you are suspecting that I still like you, you are correct.  
I like you. I have always liked you.  
But I think I am okay with this. With being just friends with you.  
I am too broken a person to act on my feelings.

And when someone comes along, someone that you deserve, someone that is right for you,  
I will not run and hide. I will not get jealous.  
I will do everything to be happy for you.  
I will be happy for you.

I will definitely be happy for you.
