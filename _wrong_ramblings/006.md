I must apologize.  
I did something horrible.  
I just thought that it was possible.  
I assumed that we were friends.

You never really acknowledged me.  
The way you acknowledge other people that they are your friends.  
Close friends, even.  
But out of the kindness of your soul, you still allow me in your world.

I know this is my fault.  
I know I am not worth it.  
I should really be contented.  
I am very sorry.

I am very very sorry.
