there was a girl in my life  
that makes everything right  
she is really everything to me  
good, kind, and friendly

she is happy to be with  
fun and laughter are her treat  
i know, she is talkative  
that's why, you will never tire to talk with her  

but one time she got angry at me  
i never had a thought it can be  
she never talked to me  
she never looked at me

it hurts my feelings very much  
that's why i shed a tear 'cause it's too much  
but when she call and apologize  
truly, friendship lasts forever
