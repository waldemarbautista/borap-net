i consider you as my best friend  
a friend whom i can always depend  
but it seems that you don't understand me  
'cause you don't count on me

everyday i always see you  
talking with friends like you  
everytime i see you smiling  
it's like you're tickling me

when i don't see you in just a day  
it's like over for me and my days  
you're like an angel to me  
guiding me to see life's beauty

i keep thinking of you  
i keep writing about you  
but i don't know if you really know me  
'cause you don't mind me
