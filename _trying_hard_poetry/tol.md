whenever i'm with you every single day  
it gives me happiness that always lights my way

i always come to you whenever i'm in need  
and your words of advice are something great indeed

i just want to thank you for always being there  
and i'm glad that you even show me that you care

i'll always pray to Him that our friendship won't end  
'cause i treat you as my one and only best friend
