to lose a best friend is a sorrow of the heart  
you may never know but it could tear you apart  
it is okay if sometimes she can't talk to you  
what really hurts is she completely forgets you

to lose a best friend really hurts deep down inside  
it spins your inside like a roller coaster ride  
it rumbles your mind until you can think no more  
until you can't take it and collapse on the floor

to lose a best friend just makes your life meaningless  
your dreams will be shattered your life will be a mess  
your secrets will lay forgotten your trust lost  
when the truth is you value your friendship the most

to lose a best friend is to lose someone you love  
it hurts so much that you ask Him from up above  
why did it had to happen what did you do wrong  
but despite all of these life goes on like a song
