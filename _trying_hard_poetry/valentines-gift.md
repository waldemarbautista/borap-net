on this special day i don't know what to do  
i can't think of a present i can offer you

i want it to be simple but memorable  
but i can't find it, for you, so adorable

so i, then, decided to give you this letter  
with my thoughts and feelings to let you remember

that i'll always be there whenever you need me  
i'll always care even if we're not meant to be

and for this, i want to thank Him from up above  
and for you, girl, i promise my undying love
