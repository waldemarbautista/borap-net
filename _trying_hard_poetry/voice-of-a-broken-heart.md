as another teardrop fell from my frozen eyes  
as another song moves into the lonely night  
there came the most beautiful girl in my thoughts  
with her gentle voice, pretty eyes, and cute smile

though this girl is an angel through my darkest days  
though it seems she can't hurt you even once or twice  
but just like as they said, looks can be deceiving  
'cause i've been hurt like no one ever felt before

whenever i see her i don't know what i feel  
whenever i talk to her my heart throbs in pain  
for every word she said is like an arrow  
that pierce my heart and broke it into million pieces

you said we could be friends but never be lovers  
you don't want to hurt me but i'm sorry you did  
even without a chance i desperately prayed  
and in the end, i wish we could be more than friends
