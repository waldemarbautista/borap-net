holding a pen and paper  
thinking what to do  
bringing an inspiration  
that i think can help me through

what can i say?  
what can i do?  
but when i look at you  
i don't feel a single blue

i think i'm falling for you  
what is this feelings for you?  
because of your kindness times ten  
i feel i am in love again

but can you love me?  
can you accept the way i was made?  
i never had a thought to be heart-broken  
so please give me a chance

but i heard you have one now  
one that you really love  
i hate to think about it  
i hate to see you with someone

maybe, i'm really not for you  
maybe, i'm no good for you  
but because i love you  
even it hurts, i will let you

i know i can't live without you  
this is not a joke but it's true  
i hope you will be happy  
while i suffer alone in the dark

holding a pen and paper  
not knowing what to do  
i don't know my heart will be tear  
but i realize i shed a tear
