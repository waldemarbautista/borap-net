looking up in the sky  
wondering how to fly  
while thinking of the day  
that goes by and by

days will pass  
and life, we know, will not last  
but even though life is so short  
we can be things of all sort

we can't help but accept changes  
in our life and also in our ages  
all of us pass stages  
we can be in golden houses or rotting cages

nothing can stop us  
to remember our past  
when we were a crying child  
or an adult less wild

all days that pass  
bring inspirations on the mass  
it inspires us to be like them  
it inspires us to be a gem

our life won't be the same  
if a friend wish us to have fame  
friends make our life colorful  
fun, sad, and beautiful

looking up in the sky  
sighing to see birds fly  
happy to be alive  
but knew death will soon arrive
