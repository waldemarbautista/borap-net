goodbye, i must see you again  
'till then i'll keep you in my heart  
i'll try to live and wait for you  
and bear the day when we're apart

there you are, very beautiful  
i must say you've grown more each day  
you captured me, i don't know why  
this is love but this is one-way

riches evaded my whole life  
beauty scorned my beginning  
rejection lives itself in me  
this life is almost worth nothing

i have only love, nothing more  
the only thing from up above  
the only thing i can die for  
kill my unacceptable love
