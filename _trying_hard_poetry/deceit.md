he never noticed her at first  
she was a simple and shy girl  
he sat by the door, observing  
as she went by everyday

he started to see someone else  
in a once shy and simple girl  
the beauty of her, he noticed  
but kept mum until the next year

she received with hostility  
his lame advances, although pure  
she was irritated with him  
but he kept going on blindly

later on, she appreciated  
everything he did for her  
he hoped without real conviction  
he felt no chance, he prayed and prayed

although she showed signs of liking  
he never knew what to do next  
he spent some time doing something  
the momentum decreasing fast

it took no time for someone else  
to take over and be with her  
he did nothing but watched and watched  
every unfolding scene hurt

he committed a big mistake  
an unforgivable mistake  
he threw the towel just like that  
and he gave up, the fault was his

he became so distant, after  
he tried to forget, he tried to  
but he couldn't help feeling pain  
he got what he really deserved

graduation brought them far apart  
it was time to grow and mature  
distance helped heal a broken heart  
preparing them for adventure

they saw little of each other  
in the two years that passed them by  
his love gradually rekindled  
would it be right this time around

they decided to be just friends  
he was sincere and so was she  
a different kind of friendship  
he never experienced before

but he knew this would never last  
he was guilty of hiding love  
this love would soon reverberate  
consequences unknown, deceit
