i like the way you think  
it amazes me  
i like the way you look at me  
it leaves me weak  
i like the way you smile  
it gives inspiration  
i like the way you are  
no one can steal the memory

i am immature then  
i always hurt you  
i am often confused  
things were new

i choose to lose a bestfriend  
for a very uncertain love  
this is my choice, this is my fight  
i will face this standing, i will not give up
