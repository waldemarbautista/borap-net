even though you only care for the better, yet  
something in your world remind me not to forget  
that sometimes the past could predict us the future  
for me you should not be compared to a vulture

yes, you also commit mistakes like others did  
but your noble intention is something indeed  
to improve the quality of life is your guide  
to your commitment and work, there's nothing to hide

you changed the way people live with your mighty hand  
you control nature with a stroke of your wand  
but if you observe the people's situation  
would it be possible if you work with caution

you are something but mother earth is something else  
don't be confused, get up, move on with your cycles  
and if you work with His guiding eyes up above  
you can be harmoniously related with love
